<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avenger's: Endgame</h3>
<p>"Avengers: Endgame was an absolute rollercoaster of emotions! I was completely blown away by how everything came together, but nothing hit me harder than Ironman's ultimate sacrifice. Tony Stark, the man who started it all, gave everything to save the universe. That moment when he said, 'I am Iron Man,' gave me chills! It was the perfect culmination of his journey from the cocky genius billionaire to the hero who put everyone else before himself. I don't think I'll ever forget that scene—it's etched in my heart forever!"</p>
<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p>Parasite was a mind-blowing experience! From the very first scene, I was hooked by its intense and unpredictable storyline. The way it seamlessly blended dark humor with sharp social commentary was genius. But what really got to me was how it exposed the brutal realities of class division—it was unsettling, yet so captivating. That twist halfway through? I didn't see it coming at all! It’s one of those movies that lingers with you long after the credits roll, making you think about the world in a whole new way</p>
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>"Your Name was a breathtaking journey that completely swept me off my feet! The way it blended romance, fantasy, and a touch of the supernatural was pure magic. The animation was stunning, with every scene bursting with color and life. But what truly moved me was the deep emotional connection between Taki and Mitsuha, even though they were separated by time and space. The twists and turns in the story had me on the edge of my seat, and by the end, I was teary-eyed, hoping they would find each other. It’s one of those rare movies that stays with you, reminding you of the power of fate and the beauty of fleeting moments. I couldn’t stop thinking about it long after it ended!"</p>
